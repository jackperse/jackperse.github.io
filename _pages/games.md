## *Our Lady, Devour* (in-progress)

## *Poke. Stroke. Grasp*

	Poke. Stroke. Grasp. (PSG) is an autobiographical experimental poem on body dysphoria. Players manipulate footage of me poking, stroking, and grasping my face while I read a poem I made about the fear and anxiety I have about living in a man’s body. 
  
 Featured at the Game Developers Conference (GDC) Experimental Games Workshop (EGW), the Digital Games Research Association Conference (Digra), the Queerness and Games Conference, and the Avant Beetle experimental videogame exhibition. 


## *A Museum of Self & Space*

	A Museum of Self & Space (amosas) is a walking simulator where players explore a museum about a fictional non-binary architect who creates the exhibit as a reflection on their professional and personal failures. The game is divided into six vignettes, which include a collapsing apartment, a house that constantly changes, and a stealth sequence in a locker room. 


## *Museum of Self*

	Museum of Self is a short experimental first-person game about player agency and my struggles with imposter syndrome after graduating from my Master’s in Game Design at Northeastern University. Players interact with terminals to answer questions about themselves and the game while exploring my autobiographical sculpture work and a Full Motion Video (FMV) obelisk. 

## *The Bad Games Trilogy*

	The Bad Games Trilogy is a series of games that explore ways to disrupt flow from classic arcade games. In all three games I focused on how to disrupt the connection between player-body and input devices. BAD BRICK BREAKER is an Arkanoid clone where the paddle is always shrinking. To increase the size of the paddle, players must constantly succeed at a typing minigame. BAD FROGGER takes the classic Frogger game and rotates the input clockwise after every input. BAD TETRIS combined Tetris with a 3D platformer. In the foreground, players must collect items to increase their time in a 3D platformer while also playing Tetris in the background.
